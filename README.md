## Frame types

```dot
digraph graphname {
  splines="curved";
  drone -> copter -> VTOL;
  drone -> "fixed wing" -> VTOL;
  drone -> other;
}
```

VTOL - Vertical Take-Off and Landing
FPV https://ardupilot.org/plane/docs/fpv-plane.html


## Features

- Model remote controled (RC) airplane
  - Think of hobby airplane models controlled with RC before drone become a thing
  - Uses stabiliser
  - Often frames are build from styrofoam
- First Person View (FPV)
  - Next step you have the same RC, but as well you can see objects as if you are pilot on the drone. So drone can be manipulated even if it's out of sight
  - Uses flight controller
  - On Screen Display (OSD) - overlays technical info over FPV video
  - Inertial measurement unit (IMU)
  - Racing or acrobatics vs long range drones
- Autonomous drones
  - Those doesn't need pilot instead they are manipulated by flight computer and missin control software
  - Uses flight controller and flight computer
