## MIMO

In radio, multiple-input and multiple-output, or MIMO, is a method for multiplying the capacity of a radio link using multiple transmission and receiving antennas to exploit multipath propagation. MIMO has become an essential element of wireless communication standards including IEEE 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4), IEEE 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5), HSPA+ (3G), WiMAX, and Long Term Evolution (LTE). More recently, MIMO has been applied to power-line communication for three-wire installations as part of the ITU G.hn standard and of the HomePlug AV2 specification.

Multi-antenna MIMO (or single-user MIMO) technology has been developed and implemented in some standards, e.g., 802.11n products.

- SISO/SIMO/MISO are special cases of MIMO.
  - Multiple-input single-output (MISO) is a special case when the receiver has a single antenna.
  - Single-input multiple-output (SIMO) is a special case when the transmitter has a single antenna.
  - Single-input single-output (SISO) is a conventional radio system where neither transmitter nor receiver has multiple antennas.
- Principal single-user MIMO techniques
  - Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (BLAST), Gerard. J. Foschini (1996)
  - Per Antenna Rate Control (PARC), Varanasi, Guess (1998), Chung, Huang, Lozano (2001)
  - Selective Per Antenna Rate Control (SPARC), Ericsson (2004)
- Some limitations
  - The physical antenna spacing is selected to be large; multiple wavelengths at the base station. The antenna separation at the receiver is heavily space-constrained in handsets, though advanced antenna design and algorithm techniques are under discussion. Refer to: multi-user MIMO

## Other

To increase distance:

- Increase transmitter power
  - But to increase distance twice you need to increase power quadratically
  - When power increse it can interfer nearby devices, including on-board circuits
- Increase anthena gain
  - But it would decrease the angle, e.g. anthena needs to be directed on drone
    - Because drone is moving it would require directional antenna tracking system
- Use diversity controler aka diversity receiver

The lower band:

- the higher distance
- the lower transmition speed
- the bigger anthena needed
- obstacles are lesser problem
- the higher penetration

- Connect radios from any type of network â€“ VHF / UHF / 800 / 900 / AirBand / AM / FM
- Over-the-Horizon (OTH) communication capability to overcome the limitations of traditional, Line-of-Sight (LOS)
