To increase distance:

- Increase transmitter power
  - But to increase distance twice you need to increase power quadratically
  - When power increse it can interfer nearby devices, including on-board circuits
- Increase anthena gain
  - But it would decrease the angle, e.g. anthena needs to be directed on drone
    - Because drone is moving it would require directional antenna tracking system
- Use diversity controler aka diversity receiver

The lower band:

- the higher distance
- the lower transmition speed
- the bigger anthena needed
- obstacles are lesser problem
- the higher penetration

- Connect radios from any type of network â€“ VHF / UHF / 800 / 900 / AirBand / AM / FM
- Over-the-Horizon (OTH) communication capability to overcome the limitations of traditional, Line-of-Sight (LOS)
